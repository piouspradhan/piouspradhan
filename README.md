# Hi, Iâ€™m Pious Pradhan ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer-in-training and Data Enthusiast with hands-on experience across backend engineering, data analytics, and ETL development. My journey spans roles at IBM and LTIMindtree, where I built data pipelines, automated workflows, and developed NodeJS-based applications that transformed raw data into actionable insights.

Iâ€™m passionate about bridging the gap between data engineering and machine learning â€” transforming complex datasets into intelligent, production-ready solutions. Now, as I continue expanding my expertise in Data Science, Deep Learning, and NLP, Iâ€™m focused on building models and systems that make a real-world impact.
